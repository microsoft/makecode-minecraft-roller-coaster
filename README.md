## What is a Minecart Roller Coaster?
In Minecraft, the player has the ability to place **rails** and **powered rails** in the world. **Minecarts** can then be placed on top of rails and will follow the track that has been laid out. Powered rails, when activated with **redstone**, accelerate the minecart. Regular rails will simply guide it, but the cart will eventually slow down on them.

With this extension, you don't have to worry about the specifics of powering and unpowering rails - it handles all of that for you to ensure your roller coaster will never stop in its tracks (unless you want it to)! It will also ensure the roller coaster has enough vertical space to fit the player and will even protect the coaster from water and lava!

## How to install?
To begin, start a new project in Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft Education and select the **Extensions** button in the toolbox.

## How does it work?
To build your minecart roller coaster using this extension, you will construct your track segment-by-segment using code. You can also use code to customize certain elements of the track, like the base block and power interval.

## How to ride a Minecart Roller Coaster?
Once you've created a minecart roller coaster, you're free to ride it! The track should automatically have a minecart at the starting zone, but if you've already ridden it once (or destroyed the minecart) you can always place a new one on the track by adding a minecart to your hotbar, selecting it, and right clicking on the track. Once the minecart is in place, right click to enter it. Then press (right click) the blue button on the pink wall to activate your minecart and begin the ride!
